# SideProjects
It contains projects which I've finished to a stage where it can be used by others also.

### Contents:

#### Python:
1. Basic Calculator
  > I wanted to create a very simple Calculator by not using the regular if-else-then / switch method, instead with a function like `eval` which can compute the equation and the function works like a normal Calculator mostly.  
  > I would also like to credit the Udemy Python-3 course.     
  > __Ideation Date__: September 21, 2017
